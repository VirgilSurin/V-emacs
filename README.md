# V-emacs
My custom configuration of emacs

# How to use
Simply clone the repository in any directory and put this in your init.el :
```
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/V-emacs/)
(require 'v-init)
```

You can also simply load only some part of the config, it should work. In order to do this just `require` the files you like in V-emacs instead of `v-init`
